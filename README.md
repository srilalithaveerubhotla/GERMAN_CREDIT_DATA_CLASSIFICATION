# GERMAN_CREDIT_DATA_CLASSIFICATION
Performed different classification and unsupervised models on GERMAN CREDIT DATA 

## DATASET : German Credit Reports: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/

Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
is in the file "german.data".   

### My project Rubric has covered following points in detailed
 
business case and value
data narrative
visualizations
data enrichment -- each enrichment enables you to implement / use more algorithms as needed.
implementation of each algorithm (10 algorithms : GMM, K-means, LogReg, LinReg, XGBoost, Ran Forest, SVM, KNN, PCA, NaiveBayes, ).Compare them in a table.
Latent Variables and Latent Manifold Identification
interpretation of each algorithm
metrics for assessing accuracy, variance, bias, etc of  models/ outputs
conclusion
